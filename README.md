## Description
---
**(Fictitious Client)** Dorothy DeLong is a feminist photographer who travels the country snapping pics of women doing amazing things. Whether it’s protesting for pay equity, fighting for environmental regulation, or standing up for those in the #MeToo movement, Dorothy covers it all.

### Dorothy’s goals for her new site are:
It should entice magazines to purchase her photos for publication. Up until now, she hasn’t had a good place to showcase her work when magazines ask for a portfolio.
It should help get her work shown in museums, both locally and abroad. Up to now, she has had to put together a physical portfolio for museums interested in her work—a great portfolio site would allow her work to be shown much more widely!
